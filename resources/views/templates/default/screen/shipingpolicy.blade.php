             <h4 class="text-start">When will my order ship out?</h4>
             <p class="aboutp">Typically, you can expect your order to ship within 2-3 business days. Upper receivers may take up to 5-10 business days to ship out. Serialized items (firearms, lower receivers, etc.) may take 5-7 business days to ship out; please verify that J & C Risher Firearms has a copy of the FFL from your dealer. During the holiday and peak seasons shipping times will vary due to the high order volume. We do work very hard to get your order out to you and apologize if there is a delay with it. Let us know if your order has passed the above ship time, and they will have your order sent to our Shipping Department to investigate the reason for the delay.</p>
             <h4 class="text-start">Can I get the rail (barrel, flash suppressor, etc.) on my upper receiver switched out for a different one?</h4>
              <p class="aboutp">We can only sell upper receivers as they are listed. Upper receivers cannot be altered from their product description. No customization is possible at this time.</p>
              <h4 class="text-start">How do I know if a firearm or magazine capacity is compliant in my state?</h4>
              <p class="aboutp">Every state has different laws and regulations on different firearms and magazine capacity. Before placing an order for a firearm or magazine, please contact your local FFL dealer to ensure that the firearm or magazine you would like to order is compliant in your state. For more information, please refer to our <a href="#" style="color:#fea526;">Terms and Conditions</a> page.</p>
              <h4 class="text-start">How do I know if a firearm or magazine capacity is compliant in my state?</h4>
              <p class="aboutp">California: oag.ca.gov</p>
              <p class="aboutp">Maryland: oag.ca.gov</p>
              <p class="aboutp">Massachusetts: oag.ca.gov</p>
              <h4 class="text-start">Can you ship a pistol lower receiver to California?</h4>
              <p class="aboutp">Unfortunately, since the pistol lower receiver is not on the California approved handgun roster, it is not compliant in California.</p>
              <h4 class="text-start">Can an FFL dealer hold a package at the UPS hub?</h4>
              <p class="aboutp">Unfortunately, we have a flag on our UPS account that will not allow us or an FFL dealer to hold a package at the UPS hub.</p>
